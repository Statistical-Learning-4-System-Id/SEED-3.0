# Summary

Scientific discovery in the present day is led by machine learning and data-driven methods due to an abundance of
measurement options for collecting data from a system. However, while a huge amount of data revelant to a 
system's behaviour can be collected, the key governing equations are sparse in the space of basis functions. `SEED` 
is a simple and intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the Python package PySINDy [@deSilva2020] which allows for
the extraction of governing differential equations from data. The GUI provides the cutting-edge data-driven methods to 
researchers in a wide variety fields without any need for prior programming knowledge.
